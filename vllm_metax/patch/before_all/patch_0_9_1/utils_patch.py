    Historical comments:

    libnvml.so is the library behind nvidia-smi, and
    pynvml is a Python wrapper around it. We use it to get GPU
    status without initializing CUDA context in the current process.
    Historically, there are two packages that provide pynvml:
    - `nvidia-ml-py` (https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-ml-py/): The official
        wrapper. It is a dependency of vLLM, and is installed when users
        install vLLM. It provides a Python module named `pynvml`.
    - `pynvml` (https://pypi.org/project/pynvml/): An unofficial wrapper.
        Prior to version 12.0, it also provides a Python module `pynvml`,
        and therefore conflicts with the official one. What's worse,
        the module is a Python package, and has higher priority than
        the official one which is a standalone Python file.
        This causes errors when both of them are installed.
        Starting from version 12.0, it migrates to a new module
        named `pynvml_utils` to avoid the conflict.
    It is so confusing that many packages in the community use the
    unofficial one by mistake, and we have to handle this case.
    For example, `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.12-py3` uses the unofficial
    one, and it will cause errors, see the issue
    https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/12847 for example.
    After all the troubles, we decide to copy the official `pynvml`
    module to our codebase, and use it directly.
